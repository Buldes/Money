What is Money-Support?
---
Money-Support is an open-source website that helps you keep track of your money.

It provides helpful information about your income, expenses, and current bank balance.

It is easy, free, and safe to use. You don't need to register, and your data will be saved locally on your device, not on a server.

Future Plans
---
Money-Support is currently in development, but you can use it now.

I will be adding new features, fixing bugs, and optimizing it for mobile devices.

The website works on every device, but you need the right aspect ratio for the elements to display correctly. Otherwise, it may appear messy.
